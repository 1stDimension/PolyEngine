# PolyEngine
This is project developed by **KNTG Polygon** and is licensed under very permissive MIT license.

Currently it's in very early stage of developement, thus backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
As of right now it's Windows 7+ and OpenGL 3.3+ only, but other platforms and APIs support is not out of the question.

## Branch description:
* master - main branch of the project, it's intended for stable nightly versions of the engine. Stable releases will be additionally tagged. This branch is guaranteed to be rebase/force push free.
* dev - branch intended for pull request integration and stability testing. Rebases are allowed here, but will be kept to minimum.

Other branches can be removed, renamed or rebased any time.
